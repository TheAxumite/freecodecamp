// The regular expression `/^(\d+) \1 \1$/` is used to match specific patterns in a string. Let's break down this regex to understand it better:

// - `^`: This asserts the start of a line or string. It means that the pattern must match at the very beginning of the string.

// - `(\d+)`: This is a capturing group. 
//    - `\d` matches any digit (equivalent to `[0-9]`).
//    - `+` is a quantifier that matches one or more of the preceding element, which in this case is a digit. So, `\d+` matches one or more digits in a row.
//    - The parentheses `()` create a capturing group, which means that the sequence of digits matched by `\d+` is remembered for later use.

// - ` ` (space): This matches a literal space character. It's used to separate the digit sequences in the string.

// - `\1`: This is a backreference to the first capturing group. It matches the exact same sequence of characters that was captured by the first group. In this context, it means whatever sequence of digits was matched by `(\d+)`, `\1` will match that same sequence again.

// - `\1` (again): This is another backreference to the first capturing group, so it again matches the exact same sequence of digits matched by the first `(\d+)`.

// - `$`: This asserts the end of a line or string. It means that the pattern must match at the very end of the string.

// So, the regular expression `/^(\d+) \1 \1$/` will match a string if it starts and ends with exactly three identical sequences of one or more digits, separated by spaces. 

// For example, it would match `123 123 123` but would not match `123 456 789` or `123 123 124`.
